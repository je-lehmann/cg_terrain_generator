## Unity: Generate Terrain in Realtime 

This repository demonstrates how the Marching Cubes Algorithm can be utilized with Unity's Compute Shaders to generate terrain in different levels of detail in real-time. The project was part of a study program in media informatics at the University of Tuebingen. This project was tested with Unity version 2021.3.11f1.
